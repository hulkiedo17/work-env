# work-env
My collection of dotfiles and initialization script for work environment

# how to use
It is recommended to use this script when you first start the
system, otherwise there may be problems (the same information
is re-included in the file, so be careful with .bashrc).

This repository is not only about dotfiles, it is about the 
working environment in general. I use it after reinstalling
so that i don't have to configure everything manually.

# how to run
usage:
```shell
$ ./install.sh
$ wenv [-u|-a|-d|-f|-i|-h|-s|-k]
```

# command line options

| options | description |
| --- | --- |
| -h | help message |
| -a | all options below |
| -u | update system |
| -d | make directories |
| -i | install packages |
| -f | install dotfiles |
| -s | source bash config |
| -k | generate ssh key |

# notes

Programs and dotfiles for install, directories to create, see in /scripts/wenv.sh

after running -i, all *.bash files contains in ~/.bashrc.d or in ~/

Prefer use -i after using -d, because some files should be in the ~/.bashrc.d

Also, if you want to generate ssh key, call -k option with email parameter, after generating key, public key will be copied to clipboard, then you can put it to github ssh in settings.

example:
```shell
$ wenv -k example@test.com
```
